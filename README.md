# Cognitive Modelling: Basic Principles and Methods

[Getting started](getting-started-with-jupyter.md)

This archive provides you with the necessary python modules that implement ACT-R's declarative memory. You only need two files: dmchunk.py and model.py

The other files show some examples: model-demo.py shows various examples of creating chunks, adding them to memory, and plot memory characteristics. It also shows an example of Blending. In addition, there is an example of a model of the Sugar Factory.
