## Getting started with Python and Jupyter Notebook

The assignments have to be programmed in Python 3 and handed in as a Jupyter notebook.
This notebook contains your code, the output, and any explanation or interpretation that is required.

You can use a notebook from the start, but you can also write your python code separately first (you may find this easier for testing) and then put it in a notebook later.

### Software requirements

- Python 3
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

If you don't yet have Python 3 on your computer, the easiest way to install everything is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (choose the Python 3.7 version).
This includes Jupyter as well as any additional libraries you may need.
If you already have Python 3 installed, you can also install Jupyter manually using pip:

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install jupyter

### Running Jupyter

In a terminal (Linux/Mac) or command prompt (Windows) run:

    jupyter notebook

This opens a browser tab showing the Jupyter dashboard.

---

### Creating a notebook
Navigate to the desired folder in the Jupyter dashboard and click `New` -> `Python 3`. This will open a new empty notebook.

*Tip: Once you're in a notebook, click on `Help` in the menu bar for a tour of the user interface and further documentation.*

### Saving a notebook as PDF
With the notebook open, click `File` -> `Download as` -> `PDF`.

---

### Plotting data
You are free to choose how you create the plots in your reports.
A good option is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
There is a nice tutorial [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb).

### Homework submission
- Hand in your notebook as a PDF.
- Put your name and student number at the top of your report and in the file name.
- Explain what your code does (or is supposed to do).
- Label the axes of your plots.
- If you've made any changes or additions to the provided code, include them in your report.
